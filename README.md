# Personal tools for VASP

This project is to creat a set of tools working with VASP. (VASP is a popular atomic simulation package. More info --> https://www.vasp.at)
They are writen by python with jupyter notebook. 

Although there are lots of tools for anylysing the results from VASP, written by different code, I don't like most of them.
Due to self-interests, I am trying to make a set of tools along with my scientific project, up to now, we have:

- dosplot
- bandplot
...

This is a very personal and constrained project, I have no time and interest to develop it to large general packages.
Let it stay small and simple.
