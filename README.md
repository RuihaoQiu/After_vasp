# Personal tools for VASP

This project is to creat a set of tools working with VASP ( VASP is a popular atomic simulation package. More info - https://www.vasp.at ).
They are writen by python with jupyter notebook. 

Although there are lots of tools for anylysing the results from VASP, written by different codes, I don't like most of them.
Due to self-interests, I am trying to make a set of tools along with my scientific project, up to now, we have:

- **dosplot**
  -- plot projected and total DOS.
- **bandplot**
  -- plot band structures with and without projecting to different orbitals.
...

This is a very personal and constrained project, I have no time and interest to develop it to large general packages.
Let it stay small and simple!
